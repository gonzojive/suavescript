===Parenscript Object System===
The [Parenscript] Object System is a CLOS-like object system for class- and generic function-based object-oriented programming in web browsers.

===Sails===
The [Sails] framework for writing GUI components.  An HTML 'sail' is created with special attributes attached to elements, giving them names that a JavaScript representation of the sail can attach to.  This is similar to Dojo's system, but works by compiling the HTML components into [JavaScript] ahead of time.
