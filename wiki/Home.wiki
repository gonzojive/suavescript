#summary SuaveScript Home: come here first!
SuaveScript is a collection of tools help people write better software for the web.  The project right now has two principle modules, Sails and PSOS.

=Sails=

The [Sails] framework for writing GUI components.  An HTML 'sail' is created with special attributes attached to elements, giving them names that a JavaScript representation of the sail can attach to.  This is similar to Dojo's system, but works by compiling the HTML components into [JavaScript] ahead of time.  

=Parenscript Object System=
The [Parenscript] Object System is a CLOS-like object system for class- and generic function-based object-oriented programming in web browsers.
