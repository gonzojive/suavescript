#summary SuaveScript Home: come here first!
SuaveScript is a collection of tools help people write better software for the web.  The project right now has two principle modules, Sails and PSOS.

=Sails=

* The [[Sails]] framework for writing GUI components.  An HTML 'sail' is created with special attributes attached to elements, giving them names that a JavaScript representation of the sail can attach to.  This is similar to Dojo's system, but works by compiling the HTML components into JavaScript ahead of time.  

* The ParenScript Object System is a CLOS-like object system for class- and generic function-based object-oriented programming in web browsers.  This code is not yet in SVN.

There are a few other things that would be neat, but I will probably not have time to do.  The coolest of these is a Javascript -> Parenscript converter--which could be done using JWACS.  Then, it would be need to embed Parenscript into lisp so scripts could be executed on either the browser or the server.

There is also a code graveyard in SVN where a few things are implemented that I do not use at all:
*JavaScript Templates: Write page templates using javascript in much the same way as JSP, ERB (rails), and other template systems work.
