Suavescript is a collection of tools that helps people write better software for the web.  The SuaveScript project right now has many principle modules:

1.  The ParenScript Object System is a CLOS-like object system for class- and generic function-based object-oriented programming in web browsers.  This code is not yet in SVN.

10.  RJSON is red's javascript object notation, which is a slightly more advanced version of JSON that allows cross-referencing and typing.

11.  The Sails framework for writing GUI components.  An HTML 'sail' is created with special attributes attached to elements, giving them names that a JavaScript representation of the sail can attach to.  This is similar to Dojo's system, but works by compiling the HTML components into JavaScript ahead of time.
